        description: Based on the PubChemQC, we define a meaningful ML task of predicting
            DFT-calculated HOMO-LUMO energy gap of molecules given their 2D molecular
            graphs. The HOMO-LUMO gap is one of the most practically-relevant quantum
            chemical properties of molecules since it is related to reactivity, photoexcitation,
            and charge transport.
